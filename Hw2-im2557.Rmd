## Problem 1

```{r Problem 1}
problem1 <- read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                       sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                       range = "A2:N408",
                       ) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0))
       


```

## Including Plots


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
